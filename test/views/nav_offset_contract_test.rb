# The nav-offset contract — both halves in one file, because either half alone is
# silently useless.
#
#   --nav-h      the header's HEIGHT
#   --nav-bottom the header's BOTTOM EDGE, in viewport coordinates
#
# They are equal only when the header starts at the top of the viewport, which is
# exactly why one was used for the other for so long without anyone noticing. A
# `fixed` overlay offset by the HEIGHT rides UP over the header by the height of
# any chrome stacked above it. mcritchie-industries renders an environment banner
# before the navbar; the open sidebar panel overlapped the header by 47px and
# covered the Log in button. Production self-gates that banner off, so the bug was
# only ever visible on QA — which is where the operator reviews.
#
# The failure this file exists to prevent is a SILENT one. The panel falls back to
# --nav-h, so if the publisher ever stops emitting --nav-bottom the panel quietly
# returns to the old broken geometry with nothing red anywhere. That is why the
# PUBLISHER is asserted here too, not just the consumer.
#
# What this tier cannot do: run the JS, or lay out a page. The engine has no
# browser lane, so this holds the CONTRACT, not the pixels. The pixel proof has to
# come from a consumer that has one.
