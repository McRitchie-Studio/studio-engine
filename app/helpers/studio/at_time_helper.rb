module Studio
  # The "at" format — the shared primitive for stamping WHEN something happened.
  #
  # A relative stamp ("Shipped less than a minute ago") answers *how long ago* and
  # then stops. It never tells the reader what the clock said, so it cannot be
  # placed against the rest of a day. The "at" format answers the other question,
  # and it answers it in the reader's own time:
  #
  #   · The clock is 12-hour with a single-letter meridiem — "3:53p".
  #   · The date appears ONLY when the stamp is not today. Something that happened
  #     minutes ago needs no date; last week's is ambiguous without it. The year
  #     joins only when it differs, so "Aug 10, 3:53p" stays short all year.
  #   · A country flag TRAILS the clock when the reader's timezone sits outside the
  #     US. Inside the US there is no flag at all — the flag carries signal only
  #     because it is unusual, and one that fired on every stamp would carry none.
  #   · The relative phrase is not thrown away; it moves to the hover title, beside
  #     the full local stamp and its zone name.
  #
  # WHO OWNS WHAT. The server renders the app-timezone form as the pre-hydration
  # and no-JS fallback, and never renders a flag — it cannot know where the reader
  # is sitting. `studio/_at_time_script` re-stamps the clock to the VIEWER's local
  # time and adds the flag from the browser's IANA zone. That split is the whole
  # design: the flag is a fact about the reader, so only the reader's machine may
  # assert it.
  #
  # HOSTS: render `studio/at_time_script` ONCE at page level (the application
  # layout), then use `at_time_tag` anywhere. Without the script the stamps still
  # render — in the app's timezone, with no flag — so a host that forgets it
  # degrades to the old behavior rather than breaking. Specimen: /admin/style.
