# The email BELOW the banner: its body copy, its call to action, and the footer
# every email shares.
#
# Same rule as the banner's words — nil means INHERIT the registry default, so
# an app that never opens /admin/emails sends exactly what it sent before.
#
# The FOOTER is app-wide rather than per-email, and it lives in this same table
# under a reserved key (Studio::EmailSetting::FOOTER_KEY). A separate table for
# two strings would cost a migration, a model and a join to say the same thing;
# a reserved key keeps one place to look for "what has the operator changed".
